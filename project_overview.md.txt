# Project Overview

This IoT project aims to provide real-time environmental monitoring using multiple sensors. The project detects:
- Light levels to determine day or night.
- Room temperature using a DHT11/DHT22 sensor.
- Sound levels using a KY-037 sensor.
- Earthquake activity using MPU6050 accelerometer.

The system is designed for efficient monitoring and potential IoT integration.
