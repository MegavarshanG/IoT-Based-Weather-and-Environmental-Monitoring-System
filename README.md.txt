# IoT-Based Weather and Environmental Monitoring System

This project monitors environmental parameters using IoT sensors, such as detecting day/night, room temperature, sound frequency, and earthquake activity.

## Features
- **Day/Night Detection**: Monitors light levels using an LDR.
- **Room Temperature Monitoring**: Uses DHT11/DHT22 for temperature readings.
- **Sound Frequency Detection**: Analyzes sound levels with KY-037.
- **Earthquake Monitoring**: Detects vibrations using MPU6050 accelerometer.

## Components
1. **Arduino Uno/ESP32**
2. **DHT11/DHT22**
3. **KY-037 Sound Sensor**
4. **MPU6050 Accelerometer**
5. **LDR with 10kÎ© Resistor**
6. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**
