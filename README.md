 IoT-Based Weather and Environmental Monitoring System  

This project monitors environmental parameters using sensors, providing real-time data on:  
- **Day/Night Detection** using LDR.  
- **Temperature Measurement** with DHT11/DHT22.  
- **Sound Level Monitoring** using KY-037.  
- **Earthquake Detection** via MPU6050 accelerometer.  

## Features  
- Real-time environmental data monitoring.  
- Modular code for easy customization.  
- Expandable with IoT platforms like Blynk or ThingSpeak.  

## Components  
- Arduino Uno/ESP32  
- DHT11/DHT22  
- MPU6050 Accelerometer  
- KY-037 Sound Sensor  
- LDR with a 10kΩ resistor  
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires  

## Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IoT-Weather-Monitoring.git
   ```  
2. Connect the sensors as per the circuit diagram in `docs/`.  
3. Upload `src/main.ino` to your microcontroller.  
4. View real-time data on the Serial Monitor.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add cloud integration for remote monitoring.  
- Build a dashboard for visualizing data.  
- Enable data logging for analysis.
